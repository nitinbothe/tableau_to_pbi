# FAQ — Tableau to Power BI Migration

## General

### Which Tableau files are supported?

`.twb` (XML workbooks) and `.twbx` (packaged workbooks with data). `.tds`/`.tdsx` (datasources) are also supported by the extractor.

### What is a `.pbip` file?

It is a **Power BI Project** — a text-based file format (JSON + TMDL) that represents a complete Power BI report. It opens directly in Power BI Desktop by double-clicking.

### Do I need to install Python dependencies?

No. The core migration uses only the Python standard library (xml, json, os, uuid, re, etc.).

Optional dependencies for advanced features:
- `tableauhyperapi` — for reading `.hyper` extract files (v2+ format). Without this, some newer `.hyper` files may only get metadata (no row data).
- `azure-identity` + `requests` — for Fabric workspace deployment
- `pydantic-settings` — for typed configuration (falls back to env vars)

### How are `.hyper` extract files handled?

When a `.twbx` contains embedded `.hyper` files, the migration automatically:

1. **Extracts** the `.hyper` file from the TWBX archive
2. **Reads** column metadata and row data using a 3-tier reader chain:
   - **Tier 1:** `tableauhyperapi` (pip package) — handles 100% of `.hyper` formats including v2+
   - **Tier 2:** SQLite fallback — works for older `.hyper` files that are SQLite-compatible
   - **Tier 3:** Binary header scan — extracts CREATE TABLE/INSERT patterns for metadata-only
3. **Inlines** small tables (≤500 rows by default) into M `#table()` expressions
4. **Converts** large tables to CSV files with `Csv.Document()` M expressions
5. **Patches** TMDL partition expressions to reference the generated CSV files

Use `--hyper-rows N` to control the inline/CSV threshold.

### What about `.tde` files (legacy Tableau Data Extract)?

`.tde` is the **pre-2018 legacy extract format**. It cannot be read by `tableauhyperapi`, SQLite, or the binary scanner. Tables from `.tde`-based workbooks get a placeholder `#table()` partition with a `TODO` comment. To migrate the data, either:
- Re-save the workbook in Tableau Desktop (which converts `.tde` → `.hyper`)
- Manually export the data to CSV and update the M expression

## Migration

### How do I run a migration?

```bash
python migrate.py your_workbook.twbx
```

Or with additional options:

```bash
# Custom output directory
python migrate.py your_workbook.twbx --output-dir /tmp/output

# Verbose logging
python migrate.py your_workbook.twbx --verbose

# Batch migrate all workbooks in a directory
python migrate.py --batch examples/tableau_samples/ --output-dir /tmp/batch_output

# With Tableau Prep flow
python migrate.py your_workbook.twbx --prep flow.tfl

# Standalone Prep flow batch — export Power Query M, sources & lineage
python migrate.py --batch examples/prep_portfolio/ --output-dir /tmp/prep_output

# Prep flow lineage analysis
python migrate.py --prep-lineage examples/prep_portfolio/

# Log to file
python migrate.py your_workbook.twbx --log-file migration.log
```

Or step by step:

```bash
python tableau_export/extract_tableau_data.py your_workbook.twbx
python powerbi_import/import_to_powerbi.py
```

### Where is the output?

In `artifacts/powerbi_projects/[ReportName]/[ReportName].pbip`. Double-click to open in Power BI Desktop.

### How are standalone Tableau Prep flows (.tfl/.tflx) handled?

Standalone prep flows are **not** converted to `.pbip` projects (which would be empty with no visuals). Instead, `--batch` on prep flow directories produces:

- **Power Query M** — `.pq` files for each flow output table
- **Source definitions** — JSON files with connection metadata and column schema
- **Assessment** — per-flow grade (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) and stats
- **Cross-flow lineage** — automatic HTML + JSON report when ≥2 flows succeed, showing dependencies and merge recommendations

To pair a prep flow with an existing workbook (merge M transforms into a `.pbip`), use:
```bash
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --prep flow.tfl
```

### Why do some formulas not work?

Some Tableau functions have no direct DAX equivalent:

- `MAKEPOINT()` — no DAX equivalent; use lat/lon columns in a map visual
- `PREVIOUS_VALUE()` — automatically converted to OFFSET-based DAX pattern (may need manual adjustment for complex seed logic)
- `LOOKUP()` — automatically converted to OFFSET-based DAX pattern
- Table functions (`SIZE()` → `COUNTROWS(ALLSELECTED())`, `INDEX()` → `RANKX()`) — approximated, may need adjustment

Most complex patterns **are** handled automatically:
- LOD expressions (`{ FIXED ... }`) → `CALCULATE` + `ALLEXCEPT` / `REMOVEFILTERS` / `ALL`
- `SUM(IF ...)` → `SUMX('table', IF(...))` iterator conversion
- Nested `IF/ELSEIF/ELSE/END` → nested `IF()` calls
- Window functions (`WINDOW_AVG`, `WINDOW_SUM`) → `CALCULATE(..., ALL('table'))`
- Table calculations (`RUNNING_SUM`, `RANK`) → `CALCULATE(SUM(...))`, `RANKX(ALL(...))`

### How are LOD expressions converted?

LOD (Level of Detail) expressions are one of the most complex Tableau features. The tool converts them automatically:

```
{FIXED [Region] : SUM([Sales])}
→ CALCULATE(SUM('Table'[Sales]), ALLEXCEPT('Table', 'Table'[Region]))

{FIXED [Region], [Category] : SUM([Sales])}
→ CALCULATE(SUM(...), ALLEXCEPT('Table', 'Table'[Region], 'Table'[Category]))

{EXCLUDE [Category] : SUM([Sales])}
→ CALCULATE(SUM(...), REMOVEFILTERS('Table'[Category]))

{FIXED : SUM(IF YEAR([Date]) = YEAR(TODAY()) THEN [Amount] ELSE 0 END)}
→ CALCULATE(SUMX('Table', IF(YEAR(...) = YEAR(TODAY()), ...)), ALL('Table'))
```

### How does the SUM(IF) → SUMX conversion work?

In Tableau, `SUM(IF condition THEN value ELSE 0 END)` is common. DAX's `SUM()` only accepts a single column, so the tool converts to iterator functions:

```
Tableau: SUM(IF [type] = "Revenue" THEN [amount] ELSE 0 END)
DAX:     SUMX('transactions', IF('transactions'[type] = "Revenue", 'transactions'[amount], 0))
```

This applies to all aggregate+condition patterns:
- `SUM(IF ...)` → `SUMX`
- `AVG(IF ...)` → `AVERAGEX`
- `MIN(IF ...)` → `MINX`
- `MAX(IF ...)` → `MAXX`
- `COUNT(IF ...)` → `COUNTX`

### How is Row-Level Security (RLS) migrated?

Tableau has multiple security mechanisms, all converted to Power BI RLS roles:

1. **User filters** (`<user-filter>` with user→value mappings):
   ```tmdl
   role 'Region Access'
       tablePermission Orders
           filterExpression = (USERPRINCIPALNAME() = "alice@co.com" && [Region] IN {"East", "West"}) || ...
   ```

2. **USERNAME() / FULLNAME() calculations**:
   ```tmdl
   role 'Is Current User'
       tablePermission Orders
           filterExpression = 'Orders'[Email] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
   ```

3. **ISMEMBEROF("group")** — creates a separate role per group:
   ```tmdl
   role Managers
       tablePermission Orders
           filterExpression = TRUE()  /* Assign Azure AD group members to this role */
   ```

### What about parameters?

Tableau parameters are converted to Power BI What-If parameter tables:

- **Integer/real range** → `GENERATESERIES(min, max, step)` table + `SELECTEDVALUE` measure
- **String list** → `DATATABLE("Value", STRING, {{"val1"}, {"val2"}})` table + `SELECTEDVALUE` measure
- **Date parameters** → static measure with default value

When a calculated column references a parameter, the value is **inlined** (since calc columns can't reference measures in DAX).

### How do I generate Fabric-native output?

Use `--output-format fabric` to generate Lakehouse, Dataflow Gen2, PySpark Notebook, DirectLake Semantic Model, and Data Pipeline artifacts instead of a .pbip project:

```bash
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --output-format fabric --output-dir /tmp/fabric_output
```

### How do I optimize the generated DAX formulas?

Use `--optimize-dax` to run an AST-based DAX optimizer pass after conversion. This rewrites verbose formulas for readability and performance:

```bash
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --optimize-dax --time-intelligence auto
```

The optimizer applies: nested IF→SWITCH, IF(ISBLANK)→COALESCE, redundant CALCULATE collapse, constant folding, SUMX simplification, and optional Time Intelligence auto-injection (YTD, PY, YoY%).

### How do I reconfigure the data sources?

1. Open the `.pbip` in Power BI Desktop
2. Go to Power Query Editor (Transform Data)
3. Edit the source parameters in each query
4. Close and Apply

### Why did I sometimes see a stray `Ae`/odd glyph in textbox content after migration?

Tableau can emit internal line-break sentinel runs in rich text XML. In older builds those sentinel runs could appear as literal glyph artifacts in generated Power BI textboxes. This was fixed in **v38.4.0** by cleaning sentinel-only runs during extraction while preserving actual paragraph breaks.

If you still see this behavior, regenerate with the latest version and attach a minimal `.twb` snippet in your issue.

### Is visual positioning pixel-perfect?

Direct zone-to-visual sizing maps accurately (including UC80 validation work). As of **v38.5.0**, floating/overlapping zones are resolved deterministically: the report-side overlap healer sorts overlapping visuals by z-order, keeps the lowest-z backdrop anchored, and staggers higher-z foreground zones by +32 px. This is stable across runs (verified across all `PYTHONHASHSEED` values) and is locked in by per-workbook pixel-perfect golden fixtures with a CI drift gate (`scripts/generate_pixel_fixtures.py --check`).

Pixel-perfect fidelity is validated along 4 axes:

| Axis | What is preserved |
|------|-------------------|
| **Fonts** | Run-level font family, size, weight, color, per-paragraph horizontal alignment |
| **Chrome** | Per-visual background + border from Tableau format zones |
| **Sentinel** | Tableau soft line-break sentinel runs (`Ae`/NBSP) cleaned during extraction |
| **Overlay** | Floating/overlapping zones staggered deterministically by z-order |

### How do I run the real-world QA suite?

Add `--qa` to produce a 6-check migration QA report card (HTML + console):

```bash
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --qa
```

The 6 checks are: zero sentinel glyphs, zero empty visuals, full number-format coverage, all dashboard zones matched, no orphan filters, and fidelity ≥ 97.

Use `--qa-strict` in CI to make the migration exit with a non-zero status if any check fails:

```bash
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --qa-strict
```

## Technical

### Why do I get "Invalid identifier" errors in Power Query M?

Column names with special characters (hyphens, slashes, parentheses) must be quoted as `[#"Name"]` in Power Query M. For example, `[Sub-Category]` is invalid — M interprets the hyphen as a minus operator. The correct syntax is `[#"Sub-Category"]`.

Since **v28.1.1**, the migration tool auto-detects and quotes these identifiers. Characters that trigger quoting: `/ ( ) ' " + @ # $ % ^ & * ! ~ \` < > ? ; : { } | \\ , -`.

If you see this error after migration, re-run with the latest version.

### What is the difference between a measure and a calculated column?

- **Measure**: computed at aggregation time (e.g., `SUM`, `AVERAGE`). Adapts to the filter context.
- **Calculated column**: computed row by row, stored in the model. Like an added column.

The tool classifies automatically:
- Tableau `role=measure` → DAX measure
- Tableau `role=dimension` → calculated column

### Why does `RELATED()` appear in some formulas?

In calculated columns, to access a column from another related table, DAX requires `RELATED('OtherTable'[column])`. The tool adds `RELATED()` automatically when the column belongs to a different table.

### What is the TMDL format?

**Tabular Model Definition Language** — a text format for describing Power BI semantic models. It is the successor to the `model.bim` JSON, used in `.pbip` projects.

### How do relationships work?

Tableau relationships (joins) are converted to Power BI relationships:
- `LEFT JOIN` → `toColumn` with `crossFilteringBehavior: oneDirection`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` → `crossFilteringBehavior: bothDirections`
- Join columns become the relationship keys

## Validation & Deployment

### How do I validate generated projects?

Use the built-in `ArtifactValidator` to check project integrity before opening in Power BI Desktop:

```python
from powerbi_import.validator import ArtifactValidator

result = ArtifactValidator.validate_project("artifacts/powerbi_projects/MyReport")
print(result)  # {"valid": True, "files_checked": 15, "errors": []}

# Batch validate all projects
results = ArtifactValidator.validate_directory("artifacts/powerbi_projects/")
```

The validator checks: `.pbip` JSON, Report directory (report.json, pages, visuals), SemanticModel directory (model.tmdl starts with `model Model`, table TMDLs).

### How do I deploy to Microsoft Fabric?

1. Install optional dependencies: `pip install azure-identity requests`
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID="your-workspace-guid"
   export FABRIC_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-guid"
   export FABRIC_CLIENT_ID="your-app-client-id"
   export FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET="your-app-secret"
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```python
   from powerbi_import.deployer import FabricDeployer
   deployer = FabricDeployer(workspace_id='your-workspace-guid')
   deployer.deploy_artifacts_batch('artifacts/powerbi_projects/')
   ```

Service Principal and Managed Identity authentication are both supported.

### How do I batch-migrate multiple workbooks?

```bash
python migrate.py --batch /path/to/tableau/files/ --output-dir /tmp/output
```

This processes all `.twb` and `.twbx` files in the directory and generates separate .pbip projects for each.

### How do I run a full portfolio assessment without migrating?

Use `--bulk-assess` to get readiness scoring, merge analysis, and prep flow lineage in one command — no Tableau Server connection required:

```bash
python migrate.py --bulk-assess /path/to/workbooks/ --output-dir /tmp/assessment
```

This recursively discovers `.twb`/`.twbx` workbooks and `.tfl`/`.tflx` prep flows, then generates:
- **Portfolio readiness report** — per-workbook GREEN/YELLOW/RED grading, effort estimation, migration wave plan
- **Cross-workbook merge analysis** — pairwise overlap heatmap, merge clusters (equivalent to `--global-assess`)
- **Prep flow lineage** — cross-flow dependency graph and merge recommendations (when ≥2 flows are found)

All reports are saved as HTML dashboards + JSON to the output directory (defaults to `artifacts/bulk_assess/`).

### How do I merge multiple workbooks into a shared semantic model?

Use `--shared-model` to merge workbooks that share the same data sources into one Power BI semantic model with thin reports:

```bash
# Pre-assessment (see merge score before generating)
python migrate.py --shared-model wb1.twbx wb2.twbx --assess-merge

# Generate shared model + thin reports
python migrate.py --shared-model wb1.twbx wb2.twbx --model-name "Sales Model"

# Batch all workbooks in a directory
python migrate.py --batch /path/to/workbooks/ --shared-model

# Force merge even with low overlap score
python migrate.py --shared-model wb1.twbx wb2.twbx --force-merge
```

The merge engine uses fingerprint-based table matching — tables are matched by `connection_type|server|database|table_name`, so workbooks connecting to the same physical database tables are automatically detected as merge candidates.

**Merge scores:**
- **≥60** — MERGE RECOMMENDED: high table overlap, few conflicts
- **30–59** — PARTIAL: some overlap but significant differences
- **<30** — KEEP SEPARATE: different data sources, use `--force-merge` to override

### What is a thin report?

A thin report is a Power BI report (`.pbip`) that doesn’t contain its own semantic model. Instead, it references a shared semantic model via a `byPath` pointer in `definition.pbir`:

```json
{
  "datasetReference": {
    "byPath": {
      "path": "../SharedModel.SemanticModel"
    }
  }
}
```

This allows multiple reports to share one data model — changes to the model (tables, measures, relationships) are reflected in all thin reports automatically.

### How are measure conflicts resolved during merge?

- **Identical measures** (same name + same DAX formula) → deduplicated (kept once)
- **Conflicting measures** (same name, different formula) → namespaced as `MeasureName (WorkbookName)` in the shared model
- **Unique measures** (name only in one workbook) → kept as-is

The `merge_assessment.json` file lists all conflicts detected.

### How do I run the tests?

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The project includes **7,099 tests across 141+ test files** covering DAX conversion, Power Query M generation, TMDL model building, visual generation, project structure, artifact validation, deployment utilities, Fabric-native generation, DAX optimization, cross-platform equivalence testing, and end-to-end non-regression migration of all 17 real-world workbooks.

### How do I run the migration as a REST API?

Use the built-in API server:

```bash
python -m powerbi_import.api_server --port 8000
# Or via Docker:
docker build -t tableau-to-pbi .
docker run -p 8000:8000 tableau-to-pbi
```

Endpoints: `POST /migrate` (upload .twbx), `GET /status/{id}`, `GET /download/{id}`, `GET /health`, `GET /jobs`.

### How do I detect schema drift between migrations?

Use `--check-drift` to compare the current extraction against a saved snapshot:

```bash
# First migration creates a baseline snapshot
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --check-drift /path/to/snapshot_dir
# ... time passes, Tableau workbook changes ...
# Re-run to detect drift
python migrate.py workbook.twbx --check-drift /path/to/snapshot_dir
```

The report lists added/removed/modified tables, columns, calculations, worksheets, relationships, parameters, and filters.
